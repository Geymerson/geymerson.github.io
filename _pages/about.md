Here is the lazy, short brief about myself that I translated from another web page:

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Centre Inria de Lyon, France. I earned my Master's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). I have nearly two years of experience working as a technical project manager, focusing on developing platforms to support social programs. My academic journey began as an undergraduate student researching the theme "Study of the Numerical Accuracy of Software" from 2013 to 2014. Between 2015 and 2018, I transitioned to the research project "Applications for Monitoring and Action in Smart Cities Using Wireless Sensor Networks." From 2018 to 2019, I was involved in a project aimed at developing a "Customized Numerical Tool for Experimental Fatigue Analysis and Validation in Free-Span Rigid Pipes Subjected to Vortex-Induced Vibrations." Additionally, I co-founded and served as the vice-president of the Robotics and Automation Student Chapter (IEEE RAS UFAL) at the UFAL Computing Institute.

Please feel free to explore my personal webpage, I am still updating it (and hopefully will keep it updated with some useful content).

As usual

Kind regards
